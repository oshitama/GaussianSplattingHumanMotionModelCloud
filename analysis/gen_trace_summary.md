# Generation Trace Summary

- **Head (steps 0-9):** Distance to goal decreases monotonically from 0.2928 to 0.2299 while step norms stay near 0.01, indicating smooth initial motion as the optimizer follows the grid alpha schedule with modest speeds. Splat 0 transitions to splat 24 by step 9 while maintaining velocity within the configured floor.
- **Tail (steps 5-14):** Final phase accelerates using higher-velocity splats (IDs 11-18) and larger step norms, rapidly reducing the distance from 0.2586 to 1.9e-05 by step 14. No stagnation events occur, and the last three steps each cut the error roughly in half.
- **Evaluation:** `eval.py` reports an absolute improvement of 0.2928 (99.99% relative), confirming convergence toward the motion goal without regressions.

These results show the rollout consistently moves toward the target pose; no corrective code changes are required at this time.
